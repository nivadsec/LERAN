    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support the iTalk Academic platform, emphasizing self-assessment and personalized learning. The structure prioritizes authorization independence, clarity, and scalability. User-owned data is organized under user-specific paths, while collaborative data, if needed in future, would utilize membership maps.  Authorization Independence is achieved via path-based ownership. Since each student's data is stored under `/users/{userId}`, access control can be implemented without needing to `get()` data from other collections or documents.  The structure also supports secure `list` operations by segregating data with different access needs into separate collections, ensuring that rules are not filters."
