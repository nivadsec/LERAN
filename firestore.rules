/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for iTalk Academic Platform
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for student data and an admin-only model for teacher data, with public read access for announcements.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 *   - /users/{userId}: Student profiles, accessible only by the owning user.
 *   - /users/{userId}/dailyReports/{reportId}: Daily reports for a student, accessible only by the owning user.
 *   - /users/{userId}/testAnalyses/{analysisId}: Test analysis data, accessible only by the owning user.
 *   - /users/{userId}/examAnalyses/{analysisId}: Exam analysis data, accessible only by the owning user.
 *   - /users/{userId}/focusSessions/{sessionId}: Focus session ratings, accessible only by the owning user.
 *   - /users/{userId}/studyTopics/{topicId}: Study topics for spaced repetition, accessible only by the owning user.
 *   - /classes/{classId}: Class information, readable by teachers and admins, writeable only by admins.
 *   - /teachers/{teacherId}: Teacher profiles, readable by the teacher themselves, and writable only by admins.
 *   - /users/{userId}/smartAlerts/{alertId}: Smart alerts, accessible only by the owning student.
 *   - /announcements/{announcementId}: Public announcements, readable by all, writable only by admins.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *   - User listing is disabled for security and privacy.
 *   - Data validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping, focusing on authorization and relational integrity.
 *   - Ambiguous relationships default to strict owner-only access.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 *   - User ownership is enforced through path-based rules (e.g., /users/{userId}), avoiding the need for `get()` calls to verify ownership.
