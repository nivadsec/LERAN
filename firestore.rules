/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for iTalk Academic Platform
 *
 * @corePhilosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for student data
 * and a role-based model for administrative data (teachers, classes, announcements).
 * All data is nested under dedicated collections, reflecting the platform's focus
 * on individual student progress and centralized administrative control.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * - /users/{userId}: Student profiles, owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/dailyReports/{reportId}: Daily reports for each student, owned by the user.
 * - /classes/{classId}: Class information, managed by teachers and admins.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}: Teacher profiles, managed by admins.
 * - /users/{userId}/smartAlerts/{alertId}: Smart alerts for students, owned by the user.
 * - /announcements/{announcementId}: General announcements, managed by admins, publicly readable.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - Students can only access their own profiles and associated data (daily reports, smart alerts).
 * - Teachers can read class information.
 * - Admins (not defined, assuming future role) can manage teachers, classes, and announcements.
 * - Public listing of user data is disallowed.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization N/A - Path-based ownership avoids the need for denormalization.
 *
 * @structuralSegregation Private user data is segregated into user-specific subcollections,
 * eliminating the need for boolean flags to control access.
