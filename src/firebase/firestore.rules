/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for iTalk Academic Platform
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for student data,
 * ensuring students can only access their own profiles and associated data
 * (daily reports, smart alerts). Teacher and class data have restricted
 * access, with teachers able to read their profile and admins potentially
 * managing all teacher and class data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Student profiles (owned by the user).
 * - /users/{userId}/dailyReports/{reportId}: Daily reports for each student.
 * - /classes/{classId}: Class information.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}: Teacher profiles.
 * - /users/{userId}/smartAlerts/{alertId}: Smart alerts for students.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Students can only create, read, update, and delete their own data under their user ID.
 * - Teachers can only read their own profile.
 * - Class data is restricted to teacher and potentially admin access.
 * - Listing of user documents is allowed only for the user themselves.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The data structure is designed for path-based authorization. Each student's data
 * is stored under `/users/{userId}`, which allows direct access control
 * without needing to retrieve data from other collections.
